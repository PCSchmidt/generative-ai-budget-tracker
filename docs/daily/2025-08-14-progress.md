# Daily Progress - 2025-08-14

## Summary
- Fixed backend startup crash on Railway caused by `set -u` and an unset `PYTHONPATH` in `backend/start.sh`.
- Patch: `export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH:-}:$(pwd)"` (handles unset var safely) + made `alembic current` info non-fatal.
- Committed, pushed to `main`, and triggered new Railway deploy via CLI (`railway up -s backend -d`).
- Railway CLI intermittently reports "No deployments found"; the web UI shows deploy progress.

## Current Status
- Frontend: Live on Vercel (using mock backend in production temporarily).
- Backend: Redeploy triggered after fix; verify via Railway web UI once build completes.
- DB: Postgres service on Railway healthy.

## How to Verify After Build
1) Open Railway → Project → backend service → Deploy Logs.
2) Look for lines:
   - "Starting AI Budget Tracker Backend..."
   - "Current directory: /app"
   - "Python version: Python 3.11.x"
   - Alembic migration success lines
   - Uvicorn starting at `http://0.0.0.0:$PORT`
3) Hit `GET /health` on the backend URL; expect JSON with `status: true` and `alembic_revision`.

## Next Steps (when resuming)
- If backend is healthy:
  - Vercel → set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` to the Railway URL.
  - Vercel → set `REACT_APP_ALLOW_MOCK_PROD=false` to disable mock fallback.
  - Redeploy Vercel and run E2E smoke: login → add expense → dashboard totals update.
- If backend fails:
  - Capture the top error lines from Deploy Logs and update `docs/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` with the root cause.
  - Common issues to check: SECRET_KEY set, DB URL reachable, Alembic migration errors, CORS origins.

## Notes
- The start script now tolerates unset `PYTHONPATH` and non-critical Alembic info failures under `set -euo pipefail`.
- The repo-root `railway.toml` points builds to `backend/Dockerfile.railway`.
