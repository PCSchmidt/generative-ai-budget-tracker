## ðŸš€ How to Continue Development

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Start Docker Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Verify Setup**:
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Frontend: http://localhost:19006
   - Database: Connect with any PostgreSQL client

3. **Begin Phase 2**: Start with database models and authentication

### Development Tips:
- Follow the Docker-first approach for consistency
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
- Use the comprehensive database schema as your guide
- Refer to the copilot instructions for detailed guidance
- Build incrementally - backend API first, then frontend integration
