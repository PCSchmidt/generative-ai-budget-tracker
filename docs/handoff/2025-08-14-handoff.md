# Handoff - 2025-08-14

## What changed today
- Patched backend startup script to fix Railway crash: handle unset `PYTHONPATH` and make Alembic info non-fatal.
- Pushed to `main` and triggered a new Railway deploy of the backend service.

## Outstanding items
- [ ] Confirm Railway backend deployment completes without errors.
- [ ] Open backend `/health` to verify DB and migration status.
- [ ] Switch Vercel to live backend: set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_ALLOW_MOCK_PROD=false`.
- [ ] Redeploy Vercel and run a quick smoke test (auth → add expense → dashboard updates).

## Quick links
- Backend start script: `backend/start.sh`
- Railway Dockerfile: `backend/Dockerfile.railway`
- Railway config: `railway.toml` (repo root)
- Frontend live switch guide: `docs/frontend-live-switch.md`

## Troubleshooting reminders
- Railway CLI can show "No deployments found"; prefer web UI logs during rollout.
- Ensure backend env vars are set:
  - `SECRET_KEY` (non-default, strong)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (Railway Postgres internal URL)
  - `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` or `FRONTEND_ORIGIN_REGEX` (allow your Vercel domain)
  - Optional: `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `BCRYPT_ROUNDS`

## Resume plan
1) Check Railway → backend → Deploy Logs, then HTTP Logs after start.
2) If healthy, flip Vercel envs and redeploy frontend.
3) Wire up a /health badge in the README once the backend URL is stable.
